- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multiple web development projects and working on my datascience skillset simultaneously! (if that sounds hectic, it's because it is! My video game projects did prepare me well for chaotic learning though...)

- ðŸŒ± Since the start of the pandemic, I've been working on both, my technical skills as well as my ethics; I do not know if anyone else has noticed or not but we are in a dire need of engineers who focus on the impact of their work from a humanitarian stand-point.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web development and data science projects. I enjoy dabbling in aesthetics and graphic art so visual projects keep me heavily invested in my work a lot of the time (check out this book showcase project if you haven't yet; I had a lot of fun working on it!
